  C. Release procedure steps:
  
     1.) Boot the PC from MS-DOS diskette.
  
     2.) Enter the date and time when you are requested to do so.
  
     3.) Format the Winchester as follows:
  
	    - Type FORMAT E: /S (and pressing RETURN).
	    - Respond to the prompt for drive type with appropriate number.
  
     4.) Copy all the files on the MS-DOS diskette onto the Winchester by
	 typing:
  
	       COPY *.* E:/V (and pressing RETURN)
  
     4.1) Modify the CONFIG.SYS file to include at least 15 files:
  
	       FILES=20
	       BUFFERS=15
  
     5.) Reboot the system from the Winchester.
  
     6.) Enter the date and time when you are requested to do so.
  
     7.) Remove the MS-DOS diskette from drive A: and insert the PC SCHEME
	 SOURCE diskette #1 (P/N 2537903-2620) in drive A:
  
     8.) Begin execution of the batch stream to build PC SCHEME:
  
	    - Press the PRNT key (to cause subsequent messages to be echoed
				  to the printer).
  
	    - Type A:MASTER
  
	 The batch stream will instruct you to insert the diskettes listed
	 above.  Once the necessary files have been copied to the Winchester,
	 the actual build process will begin and no further attention is
	 required until the installation disks are ready to be made
	 (the batch stream will wait for you at that point).
  
     9.) Each of the assemblies in the batch stream should terminate with the
	 following message:
  
	   Warning Severe
	   Errors  Errors
	   0	   0
  
    10.) C compilations may produce warning messages and this is all right.
	 There should be no error messages, however.
  
    11.) DOS messages about "unable to create directory" during CD commands
         or "file not found" during DEL commands can be ignored.
  
    11.) After the assemblies, compilations, and linking have completed, the
	 batch stream will invoke the PCS.EXE file several times to compile
	 the Scheme compiler source files, Scoops source files, and Edwin.
  
	 You will see some warning messages like
  
	      [WARNING: modifying an 'integrable' variable: xxxxxx]
  
	 displayed on the screen, however they will not be written to the
	 printer.

         diskette into drive B (*not* drive A) and press RETURN to continue.
	 At the next prompt, remove the diskette and replace it with the
	 second blank formatted 360KB diskette in drive B and press RETURN.
	 At the next prompt, remove the diskette and replace it with the
	 third blank formatted 360KB diskette in drive B and press RETURN.
