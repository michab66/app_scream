###############################################################################
# Naming conventions:
# Numerical suffix specifies number of error parameters.  Note that this suffix
# will be automatically added at resolution time in the SchemeException
# implementation.  The added number depends on the length of the passed
# argument list and allows for some kind of type safety.
#
# If supporting messages with optional arguments, place these to the end of the
# argument list so that the meaning of the argument positions does not change
# between messages with different numbers of replacement arguments.  See
# 'TYPE_ERROR' for an example.
