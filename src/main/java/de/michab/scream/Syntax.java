/**
 * Followed the scheme spec in naming this class.  An alternate name would be
 * 'macro', also common is 'special form'.
 *
 * The implementation of this syntax facility is currently very simple.  All
 * syntactic elements of Scheme are mapped to straightforward method calls.
 * The problem here is that for each use of the 'do' machinery all syntax
 * analysis has to be done over and over again.  Solution is to switch to some
 * sort of primitive notation.  Basically a 'do' is a primitive operation for
 * all kinds of iteration sequences.  Primitives get evaluated (compiled?) once
 * and will be installed in the expression.  Another problem that could be
 * solved with this approach is the switch of the frontend language.  E.g.
 * more C-like notation could be possible then, where all of the special
 * processing is encapsulated in the frontend.  One advantage of Scheme being
 * the first implemented frontend is that this language by design tries to
 * implement the universal superset of language mechanisms so most other
 * languages should map onto this -- at least control structure.<br>
 *
 * Well, to be honest, this is not really new but is standard compiler design
 * since the seventies.  In a nutshell what we need is a compiled intermediate
 * language.<br>
 *
 * TODO: At the moment this class is pretty bare bones.  Only makes sense as a
 * base class for native java syntax implementations.  Will have to look into
 * syntax related scheme sections to implement the functionality specified there.
