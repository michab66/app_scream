# This refers to a scheme file that will be executed after the bootstrap phase
# has finished.  In the standard setup this implements the user visible
# console.
# The file is looked up in the extensions package.  Note that specifying a
# file on the command line overrides the setting of this key, i.e. if a file
# is specified on the command line this key is ignored.

# Specifies a list of classes that implement extensions for Scream.  These will
# be dynamically loaded on Scream startup and initialised by calling the
# extendTopLevelEnvironment() method.

# Specifies a list of scheme files that extend Scream.  These have to be
# located in the package de.michab.scream.extensions.
# Files in this list are loaded in the initial startup phase into the top level
# environment.  Thus it is not possible to refer to instance specific data.  A
# single special symbol is available to support bootstrap debug info:  The
# symbol %%errOut%% is bound to an output stream that can accept boot status
# information.
